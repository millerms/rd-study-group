# RD Study Group — Meeting Format

## Welcome

Welcome to our Recovery Dharma study group! We come together to explore a Buddhist‑inspired approach to recovery from all forms of addiction. We are peer‑led: there is no single leader or teacher. Instead, we rely on the wisdom of the Buddha (our capacity to awaken), the Dharma (the teachings and truth), and the Sangha (a community of wise friends).

This is a program of empowerment. It does not ask you to believe in anything beyond your own potential to change and heal. We take guidance from the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, and invite you to investigate these practices as tools for freedom from the suffering of addiction. Many people pair this approach with other recovery programs; you are welcome to do the same.

My name is "_____", and I’m the facilitator for today’s session. I’m not a Buddhist teacher and I don’t hold special authority here. I’m a member of this group who has volunteered to help guide our time together today.

## Group Agreements
<i>Read these before we dive into the meditation.<i>
- Confidentiality: what’s shared here stays here; lessons may leave.
- Speak from the “I”; no advice-giving unless requested.
- Take space, make space; step up/step back.
- Assume best intent; repair when needed.
- Arrive a few minutes early if possible.

### Tips:
- Please silence notifications. You’re welcome to pass at any time.
- Speak from your own experience; avoid advice unless requested.
- Take space, make space: be mindful of time and voices in the room.

## Meeting Flow
1. Arrival, settle, chit‑chat (5–10 minutes)
2. Short meditation or grounding practice (5–10 minutes)
3. Discussion and reflection (25–40 minutes)
4. Reading recap or live reading (10–20 minutes)
5. Logistics for next meeting, location/host (2-5 minutes)
6. Practice commitment and closing (5–10 minutes)


## Practice Commitment (closing)

- This week I will try: "_____" (2–5 minutes daily)
- One small support I’ll use: "_____"

## Dedication of Merit (closing)
<i>Ask someone to read:<i>
> Refuge does not arise in a particular place, but in the space within the goodness of our hearts. When this space is imbued with wisdom, respect, and love, we call it sangha. We hope that the pain of addiction, trauma, and feeling “apart” actually leads us back toward the heart and that we might understand compassion, wisdom, and change ever more deeply. As we have learned from practice, great pain does not erase goodness, but in fact informs it.
>
> May we make the best use of our practice, and whatever freedom arises from our efforts here today. May this be a cause and condition for less suffering and more safety in our world.
