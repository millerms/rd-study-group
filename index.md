# RD Study Group — Study Guide & Schedule

> Based on the **[Recovery Dharma Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Isotp-WlUedFJlKDqjpvO7uKgVsvX3J1/view)**. This guide is a flexible framework to support a small group in reading, reflecting on, and practicing the teachings together.

## Purpose

Create a safe, consistent container to read, reflect on, and practice the teachings and tools of Recovery Dharma together. This is a living document to adapt as we go, we could also forgo this entirely and just meet informally.

## Group Agreements

- Confidentiality: what’s shared here stays here; lessons may leave.
- Speak from the “I”; no advice-giving unless requested.
- Take space, make space; step up/step back.
- Assume best intent; attend to impact; repair when needed.
- Arrive a few minutes early if possible.

## Roles

- Facilitator: prepares session plan, keeps time, models agreements.
- Timekeeper: tracks segments and gives gentle prompts.
- Reader(s): volunteers to read sections aloud.
- Tech host (if we ever want to meet online, might not be needed): manages room/links/chat.

## Meeting Flow (60–90 minutes)

1. Arrival, settle, chit-chat (5–10m)
2. Short meditation or grounding practice (5–10m)
3. Discussion and reflection (25–40m)
4. Reading recap or live reading (10–20m)
5. Practice commitment and closing (5–10m)

## Pre‑Meeting Participant Prep (each week)

- Please read the assigned pages.
- Answer the chapter’s inquiry questions from the book before the meeting. For Week 1, we could optionally use “Inquiry of the First Noble Truth”.
- Maybe note or highlight a few quotes or lines that resonated.
- Bring one small practice you’re willing to try during the week.

---

## Discussion Question Bank

Use selectively if we need ideas for discussion; pick a few that fit the chapter. Avoid cross-talk or advice. Invite “pass” as a valid answer.

- Comprehension: What does this chapter say in your own words?
- Resonance: What line or idea stood out? Why?
- Application: Where does this show up in your life this week?
- Challenge: What part felt difficult, confusing, or sticky?
- Practice: How might you try the suggested practice for 3–5 minutes daily?
- Insight: What did you notice in your body reading this?
- Connection: How could community support this area for you?
- Values: What intention feels wise to carry into the week?

## Facilitator Prep Checklist (per week)

- Confirm chapter/pages; skim and mark 2–3 short excerpts.
- Choose 3–5 questions tailored to the reading.
- Select a simple practice and instructions (2–5 minutes is enough).
- Prepare a timer and a gentle time cues plan.
- Revisit group agreements and remind participants at the start.
